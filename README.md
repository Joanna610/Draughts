# Draughts

The project was created in C++ with the library SFML. The current version allows moving draughts and checks if the user's movement is correct. It is also allowed to capture draughts. If all draughts that have the same color are captured, the game ends.

I work on the implementation of the algorithm min-max and the computer's ability to make movements.
