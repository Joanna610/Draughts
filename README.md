# Draughts

The project was created in C++ and library SFML. The current version allows to move draughts and check if the user's movement is corrent. It is also allowed to caprute draughts. If all draughts that have the same color will be captured the game ends.

Now I am working on implementation the algorithm min-max and computer's ability to make movements.
